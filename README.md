A Simulation of the performance of different modulation schemes, BPSK, QPSK, FSK, QAM(16-64) in an AWGN environment.


## BPSK

The simplest and most straightforward type of PSK is called binary phase shift keying (BPSK), where “binary” refers to the use of two phase offsets (one for logic high, one for logic low), It uses two phases which are separated by 180° and so can also be termed 2-PSK.
